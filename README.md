Dynamic Bayesian Network Machine Learning Technique

Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is proposed to filtering inference students' knowledge level and misconception. 
This algorithm is suitable to be applied in learning case studies that are used to predict student conditions based on various variables. The development of this proposed DBN is still rough and in process
